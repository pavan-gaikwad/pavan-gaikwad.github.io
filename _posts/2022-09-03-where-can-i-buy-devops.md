**What is DevOps and where can I buy it?**

I hear your question and I think we must start from the beginning.

**Clearly. I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.**

Well, yes. Let’s start top-down. As you know, usually, all companies exist to create value for others. So value creation is obviously the top priority for any organisation. Did you have your coffee this morning?

**Of course. Can’t start my day without a Subko Pour Over.**

Okay, think about how that Coffee ended up in your cup. What happened between the time the coffee was ground and it being in your cup? Someone had to package it, ship it, store it in a warehouse, deliver it to you, you had to put it in a container, do your brewing business and then it was ready. Then beyond these tasks, someone also had to take care of the tools and systems necessary for the whole process to be smooth. They had to ensure that the barcodes work, the website works, orders are taken and fulfilled, items are delivered to correct addresses, emails are sent, money is charged - just countless things.

**Yes yes, I get it. Basically, you’re referring to the delivery of coffee after it is ready for consumption.**

Exactly. That is the function DevOps fits in. We ensure the software that is created is delivered to the customer. But we don’t stop there, we have to also ensure our customers are able to use the software and that it works in an expected manner.

**So you have to also ensure that I am able to drink the coffee and it tastes good.**

The nature of software is different from any physical good. Imagine you had a coffee machine where you just pressed a button and coffee poured out - just like you wanted it. You don’t buy have to buy the powder or brew the coffee. It just magically shows up every time you press the button.

That is how software on the internet pretty much works. You press a button and the software shows up and you can start using it.

**But I like to brew my own Coffee.**

OK let’s stop with the coffee analogy, I know you geek out on it.

**Alright. I understand that the scope of software value delivery is active until the user uses the software. You have to ensure it’s not slow and works properly, etc.**

Yep, and it is all very measurable. We can measure how well it is working for customers as they are using it and we can make changes in our systems to fix any problems—all in real-time.

**Cool! I wish Coffee worked like that.**

I’m going to ignore that and add that the scope is equally more ingrained on the other side too. We have to also ensure that the developers creating value by writing features and building products have the highest productivity. You see, if they are more productive, they can create more value that we can then deliver quickly and with high quality.

**Interesting, that is a large scope. I wonder how you build a team to manage it.**

You don’t. DevOps is not a team or a tool you can purchase, it is a set of systems and practices that everyone exercises to build an efficient value delivery mechanism for your customers.

**Damn! That seems hard. Getting everyone to do things? I thought I’d just buy it.**

Unfortunately, you cannot. In reality, it’s a bunch of technology and painful change management over and over and over again. You continuously optimise.

**This seems like a lot of investment.**

It is. The core idea is, that as a business you want to remove your value delivery constraint. Again, imagine you build a car and ship it and then your customers say they don’t like the way the dashboard looks. So you take their feedback, build a new dashboard and then change the dashboard of each and every car, really fast. My guess is that would not be possible with cars. But it is possible with software.

What a sound value delivery system gives the business is the ability to respond to market changes and run experiments to innovate their way to more customers and hopefully market leadership. Companies that respond fast, move ahead.

If your competitor takes 1 week to ship a feature and you take a month, it’s easy to guess who would have a better product in a year’s time.

**I’m sold. When do we start?**

Yesterday.
