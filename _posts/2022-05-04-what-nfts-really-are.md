Let’s look at what NFTs are and how they actually work. We will look at how they work on Ethereum Blockchain but the general principles apply everywhere else.

Although most people recognise NFTs as images, NFTs can be representing any digital data. Images, audio, video, pdf - any file can be turned into an NFT.

In fact, NFTs are not digital files at all, they are tokens.

#### **What are tokens?**

Tokens are numbers. For e.g. this is a token “12345”

When you own an NFT, you actually own such a token.

These tokens are unique for a given Blockchain and Smart Contract [1](#footnote-1) combination. If you own this token, nobody else can own it. It is unique and it represents unique data! Hence the name “Non Fungible Tokens”.

#### **Whaaaaaaaa these tokens look boring. How do these _tokens_ turn into these images that people are paying millions for?**

_This is our example -_ [_BAYC #3368_](https://www.nftscan.com/detail/NS2064D515AA17EED3)

OK let’s break it down.

Your _token_ is part of a transaction that is saved on the Blockchain. This transaction has you as the receiver and contains some metadata.

In fact, this transaction and metadata are the only pieces that actually live on the Blockchain. The rest of it - the image, description, etc. are saved somewhere else. We will get to this in a minute.

**Using the token and some code magic**[2](#footnote-2) **on the Blockchain, you can fetch a link to a text file.**

**This text file has information about the NFT - It has records indicating what this token represents.**

For our example NFT, this is the exact content inside the “text” file the token points to - have a look at the data once. _(This is a “json” file - if you don’t know what a json file is, ignore - it is not important)_

```
{"image":"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmP37F4D6anmnVCzbgRUhawreyupsdbw59HvrcapNAvdzv","attributes":[{"trait_type":"Mouth","value":"Grin"},{"trait_type":"Eyes","value":"Angry"},{"trait_type":"Fur","value":"Red"},{"trait_type":"Background","value":"Orange"},{"trait_type":"Hat","value":"Irish Boho"}]}
```

There is a lot of stuff there, but if you click on the link mentioned in the data above, you can see it links to the NFT image.

**_So, that’s how NFT Tokens get linked to images._**

Summary: You receive a transaction that has some metadata. This metadata has a token generated by a smart contract. The token points to a text file with more information. You read the text data and know what image/video/etc is linked to the token you own.

#### **Hey wait, you said only the transaction metadata lives on the Blockchain. The content of NFT is not saved on the Blockchain, only the link is. If that’s true, can’t we just change or delete the content (text, images, etc.) from the links and make the NFT worthless?**

Well, yes. Scams. This has happened with a lot of NFT projects and is referred to as “pulling the rug”.

So how does one solve this?

A good NFT creator will save the (json) data and NFT content (images, audio, etc) on something called the IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) or an equivalent. This is like a disk space in the cloud; it is like Dropbox except:

1. It is publicly accessible.
    
2. Data once uploaded, cannot be modified or deleted.
    
3. Designed to store data forever.
    

So if your NFT data is saved on the IPFS, you can be assured your NFT will not be “deleted”.

In case of our example Ape NFT, this data is actually on the IPFS.

Safe.

#### **Great. But why the hassle? Why not just save all this data directly on the Blockchain? Why the links and IPFS and all?**

Because it is expensive to save data on the blockchain. We’ll cover why this is the case in a separate post.

#### **How can I create NFTs?**

NFTs are created by a process called “minting” through a “smart contract”.

A Smart-contract is a piece of code that lives on the Blockchain. A smart contract can do many things but an NFT smart contract behaves like a minting press - its job is to create NFTs in response to a transaction query.

A Smart-contract can mint any number of NFTs. In the case of our example BAYC project, the limit is 10,000.

This limit and other such parameters are usually coded into the smart contract. Since the smart-contract lives on the Blockchain, these parameters cannot be changed once it is live.

Once all NFTs are minted, new ones can’t be created. After this, trading happens on secondary markets (OpenSea, Rarible, etc.)

If you know how to code, you can write a smart contract, upload it to the Blockchain and start minting NFTs. If you want an easier way, there are platforms like Rarible and many others where you can easily create an NFT (they do the smart contract bit for you behind the scenes)

_Ideally, you should be able to move NFTs between platforms but in reality, it is hard to do so. This is extremely interesting and deserves a separate post._

#### **Can’t I just download this ape photo and mint my own NFT?**

Smart. Of course, you can. But there is a catch.

The catch is if you create your own NFT from the ape image, you will have to do it through your own smart contract. Anyone can easily verify that the Ape image has not come from the [BAYC](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/) [smart contract.](https://www.nftscan.com/search/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d)

#### OK. Let’s stop.

Enough detail, for now, I will do a step-by-step guide to create an NFT and track how it’s saved on the Blockchain in a separate post - so you can see it all happening with your own eyes. I think this should be a video tho, that will explain the process better. Let’s see.

See you in the next one!

Cheers!
