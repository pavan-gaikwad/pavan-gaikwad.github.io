**So many people are so passionate about Blockchain and Web3 systems, even after the crypto crash. There must be some rationale for their passion, right?**

Well, theoretically yes. The idea is grand, but there is a huge BUT. Technically, everything that is built currently on the internet can be re-built using Blockchains - that doesn’t mean we should. My thought is that Blockchain-based systems are looking for that one killer app, still.

**Can all internet apps be built using Blockchain?**

Yep, a Blockchain is a database after all. Everything on the internet is powered by a database somewhere.

Blockchain too, as a database, saves information and allows anyone to read it - it however does not allow modification of data. In that sense, it is a special-purpose database.

Plus, what’s special about Blockchain is that it is an append-only, time-stamped, distributed ledger. This means it records information in a way that maintains the order in which it was written. You cannot even modify the order of data.

So although, in theory, you could build pretty much anything that is on the internet today using Blockchain - it does not mean that would be an optimal choice. It is a special-purpose database. What the purpose is, is unclear yet.

**It’s like time isn’t it? It only moves forward in one direction. You cannot go back and change things. I wonder what this**

Given its properties, it would be great to record **public facts**. News, public market transactions, law and order information, public Tweets, etc.

**You emphasized public, what about private facts?**

One could save private facts too, but all information saved on Blockchain is public by default. You could use a private Blockchain that you run yourself, but why would anyone trust that data? Your private Blockchain means you can modify the data. That is a problem.

**I can modify the data? But you said Blockchains cannot be modified. I am confused.**

Yes in a private blockchain you can. The whole premise of Blockchain is that it is distributed. No one person or entity owns it, so no one person can illegally modify it. However, if majority wants, they can modify it - that is an important point. Majority of the people running the Blockchain have to agree on any modification, its democratic that way.

Public and private blockchains exist and they are a different topic, for the modification bit look up 51% attack.

We will discuss this whole thing later while talking about _consensus_ mechanisms.

**OK go on.**

Alright, thought Blockchain is public by default. What you could do is encrypt your data before saving it to the Blockchain. That way even if data is public, nobody can understand it. Unless you provide an application or a person the ability to decrypt your data, they cannot make sense of it.

**That encryption bit sounds good.**

It has one complication though, for encryption to work, you need a private key. This is a long, random set of letters, symbols and numbers only you can access. This is the seed used to encrypt your data. Think of it as a long, very complicated password. It is impossible to remember so it is generally saved in a file. This file is called the private key file.

You can’t lose this key / file or you lose access to your own data. There is no way to recover it too.

Another problem is of scoping. Imagine you encrypt your data using one key and now you want to share some data with an app. You cannot do this without showing them all the data. Because if they can decrypt some of it, they can decrypt all of it.

I am sure there are ways to make this work by using a combination of keys but it’s a complicated process. The biggest risk however is losing your keys or having them compromised. If that happens you are toast.

**That sounds like a lot of work.**

It is. Plus not everyone has the skills, time, or inclination to manage their keys. So we would have to integrate with a unique biological ID like a fingerprint, iris, etc. Or let third-party apps manage your keys - which is a terrible idea.

The UX with keys is just bad right now.

**So unless we solve this key management problem, encryption on public blockchains is a difficult thing to achieve.**

Yes, that is why the first wave of applications should be ones that use Blockchain to reliably store public facts. Things that require transparency.

**Imagine having voting machines on Blockchain and anyone could audit and verify the entries. Or recording political donations on Blockchain.**

Yep, that is one powerful use case. Although a ledger to record public facts can quickly get political. There is no way around that, I am sure the politics bit would be hard to navigate.

**I don’t think most people care really.**

That is actually an interesting point. How many people would actually care to put in time and effort for a public cause? Many? Not many? Could we have citizen organizations that raise capital to run Blockchain nodes for public causes? Running Blockchain nodes can be expensive. So we will need to find a way to compensate these people. Because, if non-profits don’t run these public Blockchains, then for-profits would, and we'd be back to how it is now.

The incentive problem is the hardest.

**If it gives more return on capital than Fixed Deposits, I am sure people can pool in money.**

Lol yes.

**So in summary, in their first phase, Blockchains could be used for public time-sensitive information management like voting, donation tracking, public markets, etc. and to be successful it has to have more ROI than Fixed Deposits.**

I think we have nailed it. :D
