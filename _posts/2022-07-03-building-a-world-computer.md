First up, make sure you read [**PART 1**](https://blockchainpicnic.substack.com/p/imagine-a-world-computer?s=w) before reading this one.

Before I start this post, I would like to address the change in plan. I was initially planning to explain how minting NFT works and I wanted to keep it free. I built the website and the smart contract but then the Gas prices went up and it did not sense to pay so much. Hence, I have postponed that post until I figure out how to make it free.

Let’s continue.

> So far we have a world computer that is actually a Distributed, Time-Stamped Ledger (**Blockchain**) which guarantees that the data saved on it is honest and not tampered with **(immutability)**.
> 
> Users log into these computers somehow, perform a transaction and pay a fees (**Gas fees**) - to record it. The transactions are sent for validation and then are written to the Ledger if valid. The fee is distributed among all computers involved in the process. This is how the people hosting these computers make money and are incentivised to keep them running.

> Great.

Moving on.

### You are letting people record transactions - essentially competing with banks. Now, what if they cut you off?

### It would be a single point of failure. No fees would mean people running the computers shut them down and the network will be dead.

Why would banks do that? They can simply use the world computer to make their life easy. Plus, this is a world computer. It is not bound by any regional currency. We could accept all currencies in the world. Not everyone will cut us off. At least that is the hope.

### OK fair. But you still need to benchmark to a central currency, right?

### Or else there are going to be problems around currency conversions while paying the fees to the computer owners. How is this complex thing going to work? You are really dependent on the existing financial system here - while also competing with them. Bad place.

Currency conversion is tricky and doing so is also expensive. This is a valid point, we will need to follow a central currency for everyone to pay fees. But this is a risk - if we get cut off from that currency we are bust. We need to think of a solution to this.

One way to avoid this is if users from one country pay the owners in the same country. But then we are compromising on the “world” bit of our world computer. Tricky.

Wait. OK, I know this sounds wild, but maybe we can have our own currency? All transactions will be recorded in this new shiny **world computer currency**. That way we can’t get cut off and people can do conversions outside our system. In the best case, if people agree to use our currency to trade in the real world, we will be in a great shape and independent of the existing financial system. Woohoo!

### What?!

Yes, why not? Instead of recording transactions in our native country's currency, we will record them in our own currency. Let’s call our currency WCC.

### Wait. How does this even work?

See, in the operating system of the World Computer, we will build a mechanism that creates some WCCs every time a computer saves the data and gives it to the computer owner. This way they are rewarded by the system itself.

### What are you even saying? Why would anyone want your bogus currency, it does not have any value? You can’t buy anything with it.

I know it’s bogus but hear me out. Anyone who wants to use the world computer has to pay fees in WCCs. We will call these “Gas Fees” or “Network Fees”. This way we create a demand for WCC and wherever there is a demand we can set up a market. This market will decide the price of the WCC. So more demand there is to use our world computer, the more people will need WCCs and the more they will be valuable.

### OK makes sense. So as long as there is a demand for using the World Computer, this plan works. How do we create this demand though, our computer records transactions, is that enough?

To begin with, yes. We have to hype up the potential though. Imagine what sort of applications can be built on a World Computer that anyone can own and be a part of. Our basic properties are that the data on our computer is public and cannot be modified, plus there is no single owner of the world computer so there is high trust and transparency.

Using these properties we can build voting systems, banks, insurance products, real estate products - many many such innovations that can run on our World Computer. As more people access these products, there will be demand for WCCs.

One more way is to make this currency the medium of influence. Anyone who holds these WCC coins, will be able to participate in governance of the World Computer. They will be able to vote on important decisions and influence the direction this project takes.

### Borderline impractical I think. A voting system for decisions? Really?

Why not? See, everyone who holds the WCCs would want the value of WCCs to increase, so they are incentivised to make the best decisions for the long term.

### Do humans operate this rationally?

I hope they do.

### OK, we can think about this later. For now, I see there is potential.

### Wait, but isn’t our computer too slow for any such use cases? More usage will lead to users competing against each other for the right of using the computer - causing the fees to sky-rocket.

This will happen and we need to work on making the World Computer faster without compromising on the properties that make it unique - public, open, decentralised, etc. This is going to be hard.

### Hard? This has been an unsolved problem in computer science for decades now. Do you really think you can solve this?

We can try.

### (eye roll)

### If you don’t figure out how to make it fast, none of this works - the hype dies down and so does the demand for our WCCs. Basically, it becomes worthless if we do not figure out the speed bit.

I know, we just have to keep working at it. Besides, there are other benefits like ownership, and decentralisation.

### (eye roll)

OK. I know money trumps everything, if we cannot make these products cheaper than their existing counterparts, we are screwed. Nobody will use our WCCs - but it’s worth a shot. We also need to think of all the new use-cases this technology might enable. Fingers crossed.

### There are obvious fundamental problems with this system. But OK, let’s move on.

### How do we fund the development? How do the developers who build the operating system get paid? Also, we can’t forever keep creating WCCs, that will increase the supply to an extent that it will cause inflation in the system.

Wow. Yes! Honestly, now it’s like running a real economy. So exciting.

We will have to allocate the WCCs in a way that the productive entities are rewarded in the right way. This is usually called monetary policy in the real world, but we will call it **Tokenomics** because, why not?

So we definitely cannot keep on creating WCCs, we will cap it at some arbitrary number. Let’s say 100 million.

Now, to fund the developers, grants and other expenses, we will set up a fund and allocate it 10% of total WCCs. We will take on VCs and sell them another 10% WCCs and that money comes to the fund.

We will create an exchange where people can trade WCCs and create liquidity. This is where users of our systems buy WCCs from the holders.

We will push for more developers to create applications on the World Computer, more potential there is, more hype and more demand for WCCs.

Let’s stop here, its late.

> So far we have a public world computer ([**Blockchain**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp)) which saves transaction data and hosts applications ([**DApps**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decentralized-applications-dapps.asp)) that create transactions. This computer is actually a network of computers **(**[**P2P**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/peertopeer-p2p-service.asp)**)** and anyone can host a computer **(**[**Miners**](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-mining)**)**, add it to the network and be part of the system. Anyone can use this computer to perform transactions or to build applications that create transactions ([**Web3**](https://www.investopedia.com/web-20-web-30-5208698)). The computer has its own currency called WCC and people who use the applications on the computer have to pay fees ([**Gas Fees**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gas-ethereum.asp)) in WCC coins. Some WCC coins are created and given to anyone who either hosts a computer on the network or contributes to the projects. Users of the network can buy the WCCs from an exchange **(**[**CEX / DEX**](https://trustwallet.com/blog/trading-on-cex-vs-dex)**)** by paying in their local currency. As long as there is demand for the World Computer, WCCs would be valuable.

Next time, we will look at what happens once 100 million WCCs are completely created. We will look at how transactions will actually be written to the World Computer.

Also, now onwards we will refer to the World Computer as a Blockchain (Ethereum Blockchain is actually referred to as a World Computer).
