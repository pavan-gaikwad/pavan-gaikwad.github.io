You could call this post a brain-dump.

We’ve all read about the problems of “long” standup meetings and how it wastes time and energy of everyone involved. Of course people are better off doing other work instead of being in this meeting. Especially with the remote work situation, where we just lose track of time and most of us are not actually standing.

I have spoken to friends and colleagues about this and almost everyone agrees that these meetings are too long.

If we all agree, then why do we keep doing it? Why can’t we stop?

Probably because these long stand up meetings are somehow “working” for us. I don’t mean to say they are working as a stand up meeting which has a defined agenda. What I mean is maybe, these meetings are morphing into something more than a standup meeting.

What are we actually doing in these meetings? If we are truly just posting our updates and plans for the day, we would be done fairly quickly. What we spend most of our time on is resolving impediments. We are also probably triaging issues. We are doing these mish-mash of things that everyone in the meeting thinks is important.

Think about it, why would anyone who feel they are wasting time, waste more time by bringing up topics to discuss? Probably because it is important to them.

So over time, I have come to think about these meetings not as a “stand up” that is dragging on, but as a “collective brainstorm burst” of all things perceived as important.

But there is a huge caveat - it is that it is really upto you to decide. If the outcome of the meeting is that people come out with more clarity, new ideas or better solutions then it was all worth it. If these things do not happen you jut have a time-sink.

The idea that I want to send across is that if you are having long standup meetings, take a step back and see if it is even a standup meeting anymore. What is actually happening and if its useful?
