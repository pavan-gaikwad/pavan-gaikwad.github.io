**Where does DevOps come from? I mean there is Agile, Scrum, Kanban, SRE. How are all these related?**

Yes, it is quite confusing. If you trace DevOps back to its origins, it comes from Systems Theory right? But that is not a useful place to start, its just too abstract. Besides, what is not Systems Theory? A more meaningful origin would be Lean Thinking. Agile is a derivative of Lean and Scrum is an implementation of Agile.

Lean Thinking → Agile → DevOps

**So I have to study Lean Thinking now?**

Yes, that would be a good idea.

**I don’t have the time, I will do it later. Give me a brief idea now!**

Lean essentially is an idea popularised by MIT researchers studying Toyota Production System.

We will start off with an analogy I have read somewhere -

> Suppose your oraganisation runs relay races. You look at runners standing on the track waiting for the baton and you think these guys are being unproductive. Why can’t they run other races while they are waiting? Or can they play basketball instead of just waiting? You make the “resource utilisation” go up but end up losing the race.

This is a funny example but it drives home the point of Lean Thinking: “Watch the baton, not the runners”.

In the context of DevOps, focus on the value through software you are delivering to your customers. Measure productivity based on this metric. If everyone is busy but customer keeps waiting for what they need, you need to fix this.

**That is refreshing to hear actually. “Utilisation” is never a proxy for productivity. Tell me more.**

The core ideas of Lean are two things:

1. Continuous Improvement
    
2. Continuous investment in people
    

That is it.

**This sounds too simple to be true, but I am convinced there is more to this.**

Yes, if you unpack these ideas, you end up with a lot of nuance.

**I’m sure. Just take “continuous improvement” for example. As a manager, I am wondering - What does it even mean? What to improve? How to improve? How do you define what improvement looks like?**

Exactly. Last thing you want is to improve things that should be eliminated in the first place. Your job as a manager might seem like - it is to identify what to improve and how.

But this is where the other idea comes in. “_Continuous investment in people_”. Your job as a manager is to create a team that can do this by themselves. Continuously.

In a Lean system, managers do not direct, they teach and mentor people.

**Does this mean that in a Lean system managers are supposed to be experts in what their team does?**

Yes. Managers are supposed to have deep knowledge of the work their teams do.

One of the principles of Lean is called “Go See” - which means managers are supposed to get to the place where actual work is done, spend time with the hands-on people and understand how work is being done.

This real-world information, plus their deep knowledge of the work helps them navigate the improvements.

**So my job as a manager is to create a good team and a culture of continuous improvement within that team.**

Accurate.

**What if I do not have deep knowledge of the domain?**

Then you can play the role of a facilitator. In this case you need to have a high level of trust in the team and facilitate their work. Serve the team towards their goals.

**How big should a team be?**

5-6 people should be a good number.

**Alright, so I understand DevOps actually originates from Lean Thinking.**

It is a good way to understand the fundamentals. I mean, I always knew small releases frequently was a good idea - but until I learned Lean principles, I did not fully understand why.

**Oooh, what did you find?**

OK so without going into the details, here is the core idea. When you ship smaller releases, the transaction costs of the old processes become unacceptable and things improve. This leads to elimination of waste from the system.

**That is interesting.**

Is it. Although a lot of ideas have been later modified, simplified and made actionable by frameworks like Kanban and Scrum, the fundamentals are super-important.

**I know, helps sort out what is real and what is faff. We definitely need to talk more about Lean then.**

Yep, doing a series of conversations for just that.

Summary:

1. DevOps is a manifestation of ideas of Lean Methodology applied to software engineering.
    
2. The core ideas of Lean are “Continuous Improvement” and “Continuous investment in people”.
    
3. _“Focus on the baton, not the runners”._
    
4. Manager’s job is to create a culture where the above ideas are practiced by all members. Managers can do this by being good at their domain and by mentoring and coaching their people.
    
5. These ideas form the fundamentals of the Lean.


There was a time I wanted to get to the bottom of where the idea for DevOps emerged. I went down the rabbit hole and here is what I found:

-   DevOps essentially originates from Systems Theory.
    
-   However, it is helpful to start with Lean Methodology to gain an understanding of the origins of DevOps.
    
-   The closest hierarchy though is in the Agile philosophy.
    
-   So finally it’s DevOps → Agile → Lean Thinking → Systems Thinking
