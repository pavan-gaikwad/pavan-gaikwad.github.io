I have spent years trying to find the best set of tools for managing my everyday life. I essentially needed tools to manage my notes and plan and track personal and work projects and daily chores. Reminders were required too. Then I also needed a safe tool to save my journals.

Eventually, I realised three things.  
1. I did not need tools, but I needed a super-simple system.  
2. The biggest constraint was time.  
3. I did not want to pay subscription fees for the tools I use.  
4. I wanted to own my data - a high level of privacy for journaling is an absolute must.

**Now let me tell you what really worked for me:**  
  
1. Google Calender - for managing tasks  
2. Obsidian - for managing notes  
3. Joplin - for journaling

That’s it.

- All these tools are free.  
- I manage all my todos in Google Calendar. This goes back to my realisation that time is the biggest constraint.  
- Whatever todo I need to add, has to find a slot in my calendar. If it cannot find a slot, it will anyway not get done anyway.  
- When I started doing this, the natural optimist in me got a taste of reality. There was only so much that could be done - now I needed to manage my priorities.  
- Google Calendar is also fantastic at reminders and is cross-platform. Works everywhere.  
- Obsidian is free and open source. All the files are synced via. my iCloud account to my devices so I do not have to pay the sync fees.  
- I LOVE the network notes feature - it forces a structure and makes me think about which ideas are key.  
- The hashtags, themes and then the plugin ecosystem mean you can pretty much do anything with Obsidian. I use fairly minimal features though. Again, simplicity was my key criterion.  
- Joplin is a free and open-source notes tool. It syncs my notes to my dropbox. This is my Journaling tool.  
- Yes, I could’ve used Obsidian for journaling, but I like how simple Joplin is and I wanted a separate app so I could focus and not be easily distracted.  

**Here is how I manage my tasks:**  
  
Daily:  
1. Look at your calendar in the morning so you know what the day looks like.  
2. End of the day move all tasks that you were not able to finish and move them to another slot.  
3. My meeting notes and preps get pushed to Obsidian. “Daily notes” is a great feature to use for this reason.  
  
Weekly:  
1. Every Sunday I sit down for a few minutes and plan the next week.  
2. I usually add the one most important thing to get done every day as a “full day” event. That way it stays at the top of the calendar.  
  
You can have your own rituals as and when it makes sense to you.  
So that is all.
