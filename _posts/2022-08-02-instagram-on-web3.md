**But I already have a normal Instagram? Why do I need a new one?**

This one is decentralized, meaning that there is no central company that owns it. And you own your own data, you are no more the product.

**OK fair. So how does it work?**

Here is how it works. Once you click a picture and want to share it, you upload it to the Blockchain or an equivalent file system (IPFS, Aerweave). While you upload it, it is encrypted using a key that only you have. So nobody else can see the picture except you.

Once this step is done, you open web3gram. You allow web3gram to access the image you just uploaded.

Now, after you give it the permission, web3gram uploads your picture and it’s now available for your followers to see.

**Oh, so web3gram uploads my picture to its own servers?**

Not really. All web3gram needs is the link to your original picture and the decryption permission that you provided to it. Using these two things, it can display the picture to your followers. For everyone else, the image is still encrypted and hence gibberish.

**Great, this means I can delete some of those “felt cure, will delete later“ pictures from one place and it gets deleted everywhere! Phew! That would be a relief.**

Ermmm… well no. You can’t do that. You cannot really modify the image once it’s uploaded. But I am sure we will figure out a way to make this work.

**You better do, or else I am not using this app.**

Sure.

**I do see similarities though. Right now, I click a picture, and it’s automatically uploaded to my Apple iCloud. When I open Instagram, I give it permission to access certain images that I want to upload. It’s quite similar.**

Yes. Except you are trusting Apple/Google and Instagram with your image.

**Why is that a problem?**

They are evil.

**OK**

OK, moving on.

**Wait a minute, how do I trust web3gram then?**

It’s an open-source, distributed application (DApp). By that I mean, there is no single owner company for this application. So all the source code and practices are transparent and known to all. Anyone can verify how it’s working.

**What do you mean it has no owners? How does it get built then?**

Good question. In web3gram’s case, anyone can submit a feature or an improvement idea. There will be a community of people who can then vote on which features get implemented. Once the features are selected, a community of developers implement, test, and roll out the features.

**Oh wow. And why would they do it? Do they have no other work?**

Because they get paid.

**How? Please don’t say you make money advertising.**

No nah never. Not at all. Here is how the money thing works. When we launch the DApp, or even before it, when it’s just an idea, we do an ICO to raise funds.

**What’s an ICO ICO baby?**

Shut up. It’s an Initial Coin Offering. We publish the idea, market it, and get people hyped. Then we tell them they can buy into the idea by purchasing a “gram” coin that we create. People who hold "enough gram coins” can then be part of a “web3gram DAO”, a decentralized organization to manage the building and maintenance of web3gram.

**Who is this “we” who does the ICO?**

It’s the people who come up with the idea for web3gram.

**And why do I trust these people and buy their “gram” coins for real money?**

It really depends on you. You do your own research (DYOR) and decide if you believe in the project to invest in it.

**Wow, that is too much responsibility on me. Plus there is not a lot of public data available for me to research these projects.**

OK, you speculate.

**Better.**

OK moving on. People buy “gram” coins for real money and that money is what funds the initial development of web3gram.

**Do people do that?**

Yes, the core idea is that if the project becomes popular, then there is more speculation and the price of the “gram” coins go up. So, profit.

**Got it, what happens later on? How does web3gram sustain itself?**

There are many ways. Users could burn or spend some “gram” coins in order to upload and share pictures. So as demand for web3gram goes up, so does the demand for “gram” coins and their value.

**What value? I cannot use the gram token as money, right?**

Well, you can trade it on an exchange just like stocks.

**OK, so it’s similar to the stock market system.**

Yes. But there is no regulation.

**Got it. But now, I have to pay real money to be able to share pictures.**

Yep, that is the price you pay for data ownership and privacy.

**But doesn’t that prevent a large number of people from participating in the app?**

Yes it does, but web3gram is a protocol, entrepreneurs can build any business model on top of it. I am sure there can be an advertising-based model that keeps the app free. There will be many competing business models but the social network and data ownership remains the same.

**Wait a second. I don’t understand. Web3gram is a protocol?** **Didn’t you say it’s a DApp?**

I said it was a DApp, yes, but then I changed my mind because Social Media should be a protocol, and not just a DApp running on a general Blockchain like, say Ethereum.

**What? What’s a protocol?**

The protocol is a set of rules that a system must follow. For example, think about the email system. You can send emails from Yahoo to Gmail, and it works. In contrast, can you send a message from Facebook to Pinterest? No, right? This is because email is a protocol and social media isn’t. Anyone who builds an e-mail application has to follow the rules in the protocol, which in turn means anyone can build a new email app and it works with the existing ones. Pretty incredible, isn’t it?

As you know, across apps, the concept of To, CC, BCC, subject, etc. remain the same - all these are part of the email protocol.

Imagine having such a thing for social media.

**That would be really cool. I mean, with this we can have more people build great apps and all of them have access to a social network from day one. Network effects are no more a property of a single large corporation. I like this.**

Exactly. That’s the idea. You can switch between apps and take your data and network with you. Helps prevent evil monopolies.

**But then if e-mail is a protocol, how did these giants like Gmail get built on top of the open protocol?**

Because they added valuable features. Like spam detection, security, user experience, etc. which were better than everyone else. Plus they put in place features and limitations to prevent people from switching to any other email.

Having said that, it is completely possible for anyone to control their own email in its entirety. It’s not even hard to do, it’s just that most people either don’t know or don’t bother to do it.

**So what do you think? Wouldn’t such giants get built on Web3gram too? If you remember, e-mail was a paid thing initially with Yahoo, Hotmail, etc? Until Gmail came in and made it free - because of their advertising-backed model? The same thing can happen here too?**

Well, probably. There is only so much a protocol can take care of. A lot of external properties like UI, UX, performance, security, marketing, etc. are built by the app developers. That becomes their distinct value proposition. So yea, we can very well land up in the same space.

**What about the likes I receive, comments, and captions? Where does that get saved?**

Ideally, all of that should get saved on the Blockchain itself.

**Ideally?**

Yes, I am not sure how practical this is. See, things that are in the protocol can be guaranteed to work a certain way. But a protocol can only do so much without stifling innovation.

Imagine that we do not have _Stories_ feature on the Web3gram protocol and let’s say one developer built this into their app. This _Stories_ feature then becomes a proprietary feature that is beyond the control of the protocol. The developer can decide to save the related data in any place and not on Blockchain. This makes the data proprietary data. It will be out of reach for other developers and they would not be able to fully replicate _Stories_ with its network effects.

As a result, the developer who implemented _Stories_ first would have an edge. Some might argue this is fair since it incentivizes innovation - but it does hamper standardization and portability for end users. More and more things start looking like Web2.

**I’ve seen this. Even though NFT is a protocol, every NFT marketplace has a different set of features. Let’s say the “royalties on NFTs” feature or the “audio NFTs” feature for music - every marketplace app has a different way to handle it and so it’s hard to move NFTs between marketplaces. This defeats the whole purpose.**

Right, that is the case. See, the NFT protocol is technically called ERC-721 or ERC-1155 on the Ethereum blockchain. This protocol controls features like creation of NFTs, transfer, number of NFTs, etc. but add-on features like royalties, file-type specific features like say, music NFTs need the audio as well as artwork - these things are not built into the protocol yet.

Since it is not enforced by the protocol, each NFT marketplace implements such features differently making it hard to move NFTs between apps. Until these get added to the protocol, it’s going to be this way. Add to it the fact that adding anything to the protocol is a slow process since it has to take care of backward compatibility, developer experience, etc.

**Well, I believe these marketplaces would become big enough to influence the protocol decisions at some point. We will have the same system as now with lobbying.**

Yes, it’s inevitable. Technology evolves fast, but people and societies evolve very slowly. New technology does not mean the human systems can adapt, so it’s going to be hard to prevent these things.

Besides look, we are still very very early. These are all just ideas. First, the Blockchains have to scale up. That is a big enough problem with no solution in sight, on top of that, we have the zero-knowledge (zk-*) problem to maintain privacy and security - which too is a research area right now. There will be a ton of innovations required in order to make this even viable.

**I wonder which other research areas have so much mindshare and money being poured into it by retail investors?**

We have the best marketing.

**Indeed.**
